- 国会::congress <!--SR:!2023-04-17-18-52,49.3,190-->
	- A _congress_ is literally a ‘coming together’ – hence, a ‘meeting’. The word comes from Latin _congressus_, which was based on the past participial stem of _congredī_ ‘come together’. This was a compound verb formed from the prefix _com_- ‘together’ and _gradī_ ‘go, walk’ (a derivative of _gradus_ ‘step’, from which English gets _grade_, _gradual_, and _graduate_). The application of the word to the US legislature dates from the 1770s.

[duty & responsibility & obligation & liability](https://www.zhihu.com/question/46664820)
?
- **duty** 常牽扯到法律上的義務，像免稅店就是 **duty**-free shop，保衛國家和繳交所得稅，也都是一國公民的 **duty**。 既然是必須做的事，一個人在工作上的職責，當然也就是他的 **duty**。 **responsibility** 則是指 the ability to respond「能夠回應的能力」
- liability 主要指债务，负债，欠别人要还的负债。比如对方借你一百万，这一百万就是你的 liability.
- obligation 主要指欠别人的要完成的事情，比如签一份合同，对方付你一百万，你要为对方跳一年脱衣舞，那这一年的为这一百万而跳的脱衣舞就是你的 obligation.
- duty 主要指工作职责，任务，负责范围，分内事。比如你是个脱衣舞女郎，你的 duty 就是跳脱衣舞。
- responsiblity 主要是责任。比如你这个脱衣舞女郎在工作 duty 跳舞之余，还要照顾自己小孩，那这个就是作为母亲的 responsiblity。 <!--SR:!2023-06-19-07-30,72.7,186-->

catholic
?
基督教大分裂后，以罗马为中心的西部教会自称为“罗马公教会”( **The Roman Catholic Church** )，其中的 **catholic** 是“普遍的，一般的”的意思，表示他们才是惟一真正的普世教会。罗马公教会于16世纪传入中国后，因其信徒将所崇奉的神称为"天主"，因而在中国被称为天主教。
天主教标榜“普世性”（ **catholic** ），所以宗教仪式相对简单，入教门槛较低，所以教众规模和分布范围远远超过东正教。
【结构分析】： **catholic** = **cat** （往下、完全）+ **hol** （全部的）+ **ic** （形容词后缀）→普遍的→公教→罗马公教、天主教

[protestant](https://www.quword.com/ciyuan/s/protestant)
?
一五一七年九月四日，马丁·路德发表了他的九十五条论纲；同年十月三十一日马丁路德在 萨克森选侯教堂大门所张贴《有关赎罪券辩论之邀请》，反对买卖赎罪券，由此揭开了欧洲宗教改革的序幕。改教开始之初，路德及其志友常常要求召开基督教大会 来解决改革中的种种问题。这要求得到德国当局的允许，1526年帝国议会在斯拜尔（ **Speyer** ）举行，准许在基督教大会召开前各地区政府可自主决定本区 域所欲尊奉的教派。然而，1529年，在神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世的影响下，帝国议会第二次会议正式取消了一五二六年的准许，议会中的路德派对此决定提出 抗议。那些在抗议文件上签名及拥护抗议文件的人就被称为“抗议者”（ **Protestant** ）。后来，该词被用来泛指对罗马公教（即天主教）抱抗议态度的诸多新教派，包括路德宗、加尔文宗、英国国教安立甘宗，统称为“新教”，又称作“抗罗宗”、“归正教”、“改革宗”。

advocate
?
英语单词 **advocate** 原本是一个罗马法律中的专业术语，指在法庭上为人辩护的人，即现在所谓的“律师”。它来自拉丁文 **advocatus** ，是 **advocare** 的过去式的名词形式，而后者由 **ad** （ **to** ）+ **vocare** （= **call** ，呼吁，单词 **voice** 的词源）构成，本意是指“（为某人）在法庭上呼吁”。肯为某人在法庭上呼吁，自然就是支持某人了。因此，该词后来引申出支持（人）、提倡（者）的意思。
由于英国法律受罗马法影响较小，因此在英语中， **advocate** 一般表示“支持者或提倡者”，而用 **barrister** 来表示律师。仅当专指遵循罗马法的国家或地区（如苏格兰）或一些特别法庭中的“律师”，才用 **advocate** 一词表示。
[advocate](https://www.quword.com/etym/s/advocate)：['ædvəkeɪt] **n.** 提倡者，支持者，律师 **vt.** 提倡，支持，拥护 <!--SR:!2023-06-17-15-13,69.7,186-->

barrister
?
在英国，律师分成两种： **barrister** 和 **solicitor** 。 **barrister** 是出庭律师、大律师，具有上庭辩护的资格，常根据其发音称为“巴律师”； **solicitor** 是事务律师，只能办理法律事务，不能上庭辩护，常根据其发音称为“沙律师”。 **barrister** 中的 **bar** 指的是庭审现场中将法庭和旁听席分开的围栏，因此 **barrister** 的字面意思就是有资格越过围栏，上庭辩护的律师 <!--SR:!2023-08-17-19-02,103.3,186-->

fiscal: 国家财政
?
在古罗马时期，在钱包发明之前，商人用一种用灯芯草茎或芦苇变成的小篮子装钱。这种小篮子在拉丁语中叫 **fiscus** 。 **fiscus** 在古罗马用得极为普遍，因而古罗马帝国的财库也叫做 **fiscus** ，它的形容词是 **fiscalis** 。英语单词 **fiscal** 就是从拉丁语 **fiscalis** 演变而来的，原意是“皇家财库的”，随着社会政治制度的变迁，该词的意思也演变为“国家财政的”之意。
[fiscal](https://www.quword.com/etym/s/fiscal)：['fɪsk(ə)l]  **adj.** 会记的，财政的，国库的

?
英语单词 **lobby** 的本意是指建筑物的大堂、门厅。在英美等国，很多政治说客喜欢守在国会大厦的门厅内，在议员进入国会开会之前或之后的短暂时间内，对议员展开游说活动。因此原本表示“门厅” **lobby** 一词衍生出“政治游说”的含义。
[lobby](https://www.quword.com/etym/s/lobby)： ['lɒbɪ] **n.** 门厅，大堂，休息室 **v.** 游说
[lobbyist](https://www.quword.com/etym/s/lobbyist)： ['lɒbɪɪst] **n.** 说客 <!--SR:!2023-04-19-17-44,44.3,184-->
