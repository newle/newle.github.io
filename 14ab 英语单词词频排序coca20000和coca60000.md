[duty & responsibility & obligation & liability](https://www.zhihu.com/question/46664820)
- **duty**常牽扯到法律上的義務，像免稅店就是**duty**-free shop，保衛國家和繳交所得稅，也都是一國公民的**duty**。 既然是必須做的事，一個人在工作上的職責，當然也就是他的**duty**。 **responsibility**則是指the ability to respond「能夠回應的能力」
- liability 主要指债务，负债，欠别人要还的负债。比如对方借你一百万，这一百万就是你的liability.
- obligation主要指欠别人的要完成的事情，比如签一份合同，对方付你一百万，你要为对方跳一年脱衣舞，那这一年的为这一百万而跳的脱衣舞就是你的obligation.
- duty主要指工作职责，任务，负责范围，分内事。比如你是个脱衣舞女郎，你的duty就是跳脱衣舞。
- responsiblity主要是责任。比如你这个脱衣舞女郎在工作duty跳舞之余，还要照顾自己小孩，那这个就是作为母亲的responsiblity。
