Step one is to write out:
- Everything you hate about your current life (I don’t want to hear about positive thinking right now, you’re wrong).
- Exactly what kind of life you will have if you don’t change those things.


All of those habits became a part of my life for 3 specific reasons:
- I was deeply aware of a painful problem in my life
- I searched for evidence to support a desirable future version of myself
- I changed my physical and digital environments to solidify my new identity
- I blocked out time during the week to do those things as if I were going to be doing them for the rest of my life


Pull out a paper and map out exactly what you are going to do that week down to the hour. Review and iterate every week. You need that feedback loop.
