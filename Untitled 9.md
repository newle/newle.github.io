Okay, sure. So, start with my introduction. My name is the. I've graduated in from it then, but in year 2,022, post that, I've joined Amazon as a software development engineer 1. 
好的，当然。 那么，从我的介绍开始。 我的名字是。 我已经毕业了， 但是在2022年， 之后， 我加入了亚马逊，成为一名软件开发工程师。
Since then, I've been working in the consumer payments team. So a team at a large scale handles all the payments related things on the Amazon side worldwide. 
从那以后，我一直在消费者支付团队工作。 因此，一个大规模的团队处理亚马逊全球所有与支付相关的事情。
So, my first team was launching Amazon Insurance product store. So we launched Amazon Insurance Store in the UK marketplace. 
所以，我的第一个团队推出了亚马逊保险产品商店。 所以我们在UK市场推出了亚马逊保险商店。
So basically, you were the product owners. And when I was, when I joined post six months, we launched the product. So in the first six months of my joining, I worked on like couple of things related to option operational readiness, like make service resilient for launching and adding logins and metrics for easy debugging and making sure it's scaled up in a, so that whatever the customer that we're expecting traffic we're expecting, we're, we will be able to support that post, that post launch. 
所以基本上，你们是产品负责人。 当我加入公司六个月后，我们推出了产品。 所以在我加入的前六个月， 我做了一些与期权操作准备相关的事情， 比如让服务具有启动的弹性，添加登录和指标以便于调试，并确保它在a中扩展， 因此，无论我们期望的客户是什么，我们都期望流量， 我们是， 我们将能够支持该职位， 该帖子发布。
I worked on the final conversion projects, some of the final conversion projects. So basically, our aim was to increase the customer flow. 
我参与了最终的转换项目，一些最终的转换项目。 所以基本上， 我们的目标是增加客户流量。
So we launched multiple marketing strategies on the UI as well, including some banners and promotional offers. And then I even worked on payment analyzer project. 
因此，我们也在UI上推出了多种营销策略，包括一些横幅和促销优惠。 然后我甚至参与了付款分析器项目。
So the Payment Analyzer project was to identify like what are the gaps in our payment systems as in like why were the customers dropping from checkout till the complete purchase payment? 
所以支付分析器项目的目的是确定我们支付系统中存在哪些漏洞，例如为什么客户从结账到完成购买付款都在下降？
So that was there. And post that, I switched my team to the core payments team. So now we work on launching alternate payment methods. 
所以那是在那里。 在那之后，我把我的团队转到了核心支付团队。 所以现在我们致力于推出替代支付方式。
Like we have UPI and India, if you heard about it. Similarly, we launch a alternative methods when different countries, for example, we own switch payment method in Sweden. 
就像我们有UPI和印度，如果你听说过的话。 同样， 当不同的国家， 例如， 我们在瑞典拥有Switch支付方法。
And then we own ideal and Netherland and Germany, so that's what we do. 
然后我们拥有理想、荷兰和德国， 这就是我们所做的。
Okay. 
好的。
Yeah, so in the past, like the project which I'm currently working on is, so do you have any questions on these things yet? 
是的， 所以在过去， 就像我现在正在做的项目一样， 你对这些事情有什么问题吗？
Yeah, I just going to know you can give me some business scenario about your about you draw your job, your project. And yeah, please give me a specific in concrete one. 
是的，我只是想知道你可以给我一些关于你的商业场景，比如你画你的工作，你的项目。 是的， 请给我一个具体的。
Sure. 
当然。
Yeah. So. 
是的。 所以。
Yeah, so I basically work as a full stack developer regarding business scenario. So right now, our team launches payment methods, right? 
是的，所以我基本上是业务场景的全栈开发人员。 所以现在， 我们的团队推出支付方式， 对吧？
So every, like all the transactions that go through, retail transactions that go through Amazon as, and not just retail, even the Prime Video and in every Amazon business. 
所以每一个， 像所有的交易一样， 通过亚马逊的零售交易， 不仅仅是零售， 甚至是Prime Video和亚马逊的每个业务。
So there are multiple options to select the payment methods, right? 
所以有多个选项可以选择付款方式， 对吧？
So we enable that particular payment method on that pay select page, so that customer, if on, they can select that payment method and go ahead. 
因此，我们在支付选择页面启用该特定支付方式， 这样客户， 如果打开， 他们可以选择该支付方式并继续。
So if the customer selects that payment method, then complete like transition from like initiating payment till the payment complete and everything is handled by us, like contacting the backend partner. 
因此，如果客户选择该付款方式， 然后完成从发起付款到付款完成的过渡，一切都由我们处理， 就像联系后端合作伙伴一样。
This is a payment process. For example, like we have stripe in case of a switch. So we handle the Amazon side as well. And then we also collaborate with the payment processes as well to complete the rule. 
这是一个支付过程。 例如，我们有条纹以防切换。 所以我们也处理亚马逊方面。 然后我们也与支付过程合作来完成规则。
Yeah. Okay. 
是的。 好的。
And we have a like good traffic on our payment methods. We own multiple payment methods. So like we have a good amount of traffic on those. 
我们的支付方式也有很好的流量。 我们拥有多种支付方式。 所以我们在这些方面有很好的流量。
So, you are responsible for Amazon's meetings payment. So it, it, it just use all over the world. I think Amazon just run the business in different country. 
所以，你负责亚马逊的会议付款。 所以它，它，它只是在世界各地使用。 我认为亚马逊只是在不同的国家经营业务。
So there is different payment option in different country. So that you just responsible for the for tool to integrate the local bank or not or you, or you provide some standard so that they can deviate it with you. 
所以在不同的国家有不同的付款方式。 所以你只负责整合当地银行的工具或不或你， 或者你提供一些标准，这样他们就可以和你一起偏离。
Yeah. 
嗯。
I know she. We don't provide to any standard, like we provide basically the integration with the different payment methods, right? 
我认识她。 我们不提供任何标准， 就像我们基本上提供不同支付方式的集成， 对吗？
We don't have our own bank or something like that, but we connect Amazon retail customers to the different modes of payment. 
我们没有自己的银行或类似的东西， 但我们将亚马逊零售客户与不同的支付方式联系起来。


So basic aim before, basic aim for the artist, increasing customer, like increasing customer experience as in like we have now enabled some payment methods, for example, Blake, in which is only a one click payment method after the customer accepts mandates like one time, right? 
It's one click payment method. And it also helps us by reducing the cost of transaction, which is incurred by Amazon. 
Also, you do the, do not only the backend part, you still do some front end friend, front end job, right? 

Yeah, yeah. So this one unified system where, which is called Pay Select Page. So, and it has a plugin service based architecture. 

Yeah, yeah. So this one unified system where, which is called Pay Select Page. So, and it has a plugin service based architecture. 

Okay, so let's unified system for all different business line. They should use your use, use your use the Pro, use the service you provided, right? 

So yeah, we do the frontend as well. 
Yeah. Okay. 
Okay, so may I ask how many of your business line that use, use using the function you provided or just all of the company just use the function? 
Yeah, so business as in you're trying to say Amazon businesses, right? Like different Amazon businesses. 
Yeah, I just want to know. I think m. Amazon had. Amazon has an payment method before and they already have. So, this is the payment call in Amazon, right? 
So, I'm sorry, I didn't get. This is a payment call as in. 
I just want to know, you provide, is it used internal, internal over the different business line. I think Amazon is big enough. 
They have different business in different country. So, every business, just use your U, using the service you provided here. 

Yeah, yeah. So basically every Amazon business uses the service that we provide. Basically, it's region dependent. So we cannot enable every bandmethod in every region. 

But yeah, if there's a country whereby a single bandmethod is there, so we launch it for every Amazon business, be it retail websites, be Prime Video, be it any digital subscriptions like we have ebooks, right? 

Kindle as ebooks. So even we enable that on the Kindle as well. 
Yeah, so ebooks, even if you download Amazon Kindle app from the App Store, or if you have the Kindle device and if you try to purchase on that, and if you're in that particular, it's, for example, if you're in seasons Sweden, you'll see the switch as a payment method option. 
So we, I think the, the, it has a high traffic, right? What's the KPS of this service? 

Yeah, so we have like good high traffic. So I'll tell you some numbers. So for switch, we have around and the P cards, we have around like 35 to 40 transaction per second for just for Amazon retail. 

So the transactions which we just go through the Amazon website, we have around 35 to 40 transactions per second. And the peak time in the, of a big durations, it goes to up to 2, 3 as well. 

Yeah, yes, 100 insurance store in year 2,022 October. So basically, it doesn't initiative from an Amazon, the partner up with the third party insurers in a UK. 








No. So it's maintained by our team only. So our team only is responsible. So an Amazon, we have like services divided between team. 
So if our teams own the service, it they want on the pipeline as well. 
I just want to ask another question about, do you have other experience, any online issue? I think of you like payment insurance is very critical service. 
So do you have ever experience any online issue and how you deal with it? 
Online issue as in like your tech issue you're talking about. Right. 
Select, talking about Amazon Insurance Store in that field, Amazon Insurance Store. So we have had a multiple problems. 
So one of the problem which I worked on was, so we initially launch with three insurers, right? AGS, co op and LV. Then we had in pipeline to launch the fourth insurer, which was policy expert. 
We launch like four to five months after that. So before launching anything to the customers, we do friends and family testing within Amazon, right? 
No. So yeah, so because the policy expert was like still not announced in the media or anything. So we didn't want to like let anybody else know that we're launching the policy expert because of compliance reasons. \
So one of the task which I was given was. 
To somehow a design a system whereby I can add a customer override to my system, like wherever the uncomplete my complete retail store, Amazon insurance store, I, if I only want only those people to see the insurers and the codes and the, if only those people are like allowed to buy the policy. 
So it should be there and should don't be like a long process, it should be very dynamic. So if I say you that we have to add a customer, which can use this fourth insurer as an option. 
So I should be able to do it within like 15 minutes, not more than that. Because otherwise the repercussion was we had to do the. 
If it weren't for this system, and as an if, we didn't had the system, then we would have to do the testing on the off peak cards, right? 

Even then, there's no guarantee as such that nobody know customer will ever like open the website during the off peak cards, right? 
So as design, I was designing the system. So I did a pretty much good research on it. The first part was I identifying where all we show customer insurers on our page, so that was most important thing I had to like do a thorough research so that I don't miss anything, even the legal terms and compliance pages as well, right? 
So even that had to be carefully monitored. Was then I designed a system whereby I used an Amazon tool called Verto. So what it used to do, it's kind of a dynamic conflict whereby you can maintain a config as in the JSON config in our, on the UI. 
So if you upgraded within two to three minutes, like it starts reflecting. And so it was basically a service, right? So basically it was a service, which is, which was like able to reflect the changes and like within two to three minutes. 
I designed config in the, in that way and then integrated it with my backend systems so that, let's suppose, if I will, launching a new customer, a new, we launching a new insurer, right? 
And if I have entered that only this customer, so we have customer ID for each customer, right? So if only this customer was required to see that particular insurer, I, I, if I mention that customer ID, then only that will be, so we kind of maintained and allow listed values like list of allow listed customer. 
So which are able to see that, and the integrated backend system, did the change on the front end system as well so that the changes will appear good and need. 
And then we launched. So, and it was very helpful because earlier, we could do friends and family testing only for like one day or half a day in the night time only, right? 
But then with the help of that, we were able to come do the front friends and family testing for one week because there was complete control on us that who will be able to see the insurer. 

And we actually did got various issues there as well because like, if you have a one week of testing, right, there can be like multiple scenarios. 
Chen Hao, how, how many orders should be, be, really be made in that one week? 
It could be tested, which should TikTok and. 
In that one week. So in that one week only, the Amazon's, Amazon internal, like selected people were given the access to that insurance. 
So only like 20 to 80 people we gave access and out of that, we got around 40 to 50 purchases. And that friends and family. 
And most of them were from the product managers as well. And from the, like from the TikTok, so review leadership also review. 
Got. So it works fine, right? 
Yeah, it worked fine. So my, the design which I did would find there were many other thing in the launch, like the designing. 
Thank you, page. We have the your insurer page. So there were some issues in that. We were able to get. But yeah, the design which I worked on, which was called Andon caught, by the way. 
So name of the project was end on court, and it worked fine, completely fine. 
Yeah, so I even have, it's in like payments analyzer thing, which I did. If you want to know about another experience. 
Yeah, I want to know, do you have a experience online incident and you need to deal with it. But emerging, I, it's some emergency situation. 
Okay, so it's something you're trying to say is customer impacting, and then I had to deal with it, right? Yeah, so I did one project. 

Basically, it was kind of a, it was also funnel conversion project for insurance, too. So as a part of that, what we did, we were asking questions from the customers as in like if you have the current in policy somewhere else, how can you tell us if, like when will that ensure what, when will that policy be over so we can contact you during that time or when we one month before that. 

So we design this kind of system. So I did the backend and front end for that as well. So we designed a widget on our landing page, like on the very first page that customer sees. 

So I designed a widget, right? And then we had a questionnaire service. So basically, which was, which is designed in a generic manner so that any questionnaire that we want to take from the customers that service would be the backend handling service for that. 
So we had a long, very long questionfor the buildings as in like what, where your properties and everything is, right? So I reuse that property. 
You reuse that service to create the questionnaire. So what happened post launch would happen. So because both of the questionnaires were using the same service, so for the people who are like filling the questionnaire, which I designed, there was an issue on the your insurance page, as in the page where all the orders are shown, right? 
So there was a problem on that page, and that was in the live production. So that was in the live production and that happened. 
So it was a big thing because many people are visiting the website, and if they had filled that form, their wine insurance fee just failing, which was like leading to another problem because customers were not able to see their previously failed forms, right? 
So I got around, we got the issue around like seven PM in the evening. I was not the on call that time. So the person on call, like he called me and said there's an issue. 
So quickly worked on the root cause. First of all, we worked on the root cause very quickly as, and like what is causing issue and where the customers were not able to load it. 
So the issue was mainly with the config change, which we did because there was a query running on that service, and that query was asking for certain fields. 
Now those certain fields were not there in my question it. And because of that, the, that service was throwing an exception, and because it was throwing an exception to the page wasn't loading and then the API wasn't giving response and the page wasn't loading, right? 
So that was basic root cause of it. And then there was no option to change it from any like dynamically. So we had to make the code chain and to then do deployment. 
So we quickly understood it. Within an hour, I was able to push the changes in, like raise the pull request, the on call reviewed the, but reviewed my changes and then we merged it. 
There were some like we, we. So that day was actually Thursday night, and we are not supposed to do the deployment on the Fridays, right? 
Because if it takes anything, I, we don't want to put any people in position that they have to work on weekend. So, so we, but we actually like, because it was the liquid, your insurance pages failing. 
So we took permission from a manager. He discussed with the leadership that this is the required thing, and since we didn't want to run Thursday, we kind of did it on Thursday night only with the exception that, yeah, because this, it needs to be fixed, right? 
So I, so it really, it, if you ruled out like one hours later. 
Yeah, yeah. So, and I know I was able to raise the request and then within an hour, within another hour, because we have to push it through pipeline, right? 
It had to reach to alpha stage and then it reached beta stage. Then the integration test trend, and then there was a quality assurance check as well. 
And so in another, into our, there's, we were able to resolve the issue completely. 
How many percent of the, the, the, how many percent of the customer be impacted? 
Yeah, so not all the customers, but targets because your insurance page was not open by all the customers. So it does at this very last day. 
So I, if the person has filled the questionnaire and then he goes, he wants to revisit that thing. Only then he will open that questionnaire, right? 
So not too much, right? Just a specific scenario will trigger such problem. 
But yeah, I don't. 10 data points we had till we identified the issue. And then within, like around, it was below hundred as far as I remember, it was below hundred before we fixed it because it was nighttime as well. 
So yeah, before, yeah, I just below hundred. 
With that mention, Amazon Insurance Store new product. So we kind of had the, like, we didn't add that much traffic because it was very initial time, right? 

Whether that feature ended up putting like we got around like how more than thousand response in a like in two to three weeks. 
And we got the data like when will the customer be able to buy. So we were able to present the data to the product team, and they're very happy with it. 


Okay, now we have 0, 9 query for is supposed to answer 16, but we're getting three somehow. And for this, we're getting one. 

So technically debug it. 
所以从技术上调试它。
Hello. 
你好。
Yeah, you can divide it. Of course you can debug it. 
是的，你可以分它。 你当然可以分它。
Yes. 
是的。
I'll quickly debug it. So for this, then test to be equal to m, sorry, this was a fault. TikTok length has to be equal to m. 
我会快速调试它。 所以对于这个，然后测试等于m，对不起，这是一个错误。 TikTok长度必须等于m。
So. 
所以。
So that's why it was giving three. So now it should give the correct answer for the fourth query. Yeah, it's giving 16 and it's getting one. 
这就是为什么它给出了三个。 所以现在它应该给出第四个问题的正确答案。 是的， 它给出16，得到1。
Okay. 
好的。
Yeah, so everything is fine. 
是的， 所以一切都很好。
You can like verify. 
你可以喜欢验证。
Nice. No problem. I think it works fine now. Okay, so it's your turn. Do you have any question to ask me about the opportunity? 
不错。 没问题。 我觉得现在可以了。 好的，轮到你了。 关于这个机会，你有什么问题要问我吗？
Yeah. 
嗯。
SMB, are you from like same team which is hiring for the. 
SMB， 你是来自同一个团队吗？
Yeah, I'm from the 17, but different engineer. I'm the I'm the engineer manager in different part of this group. So you, you have, you have another technical manager here. 
是的，我来自17，但不同的工程师。 我是这个小组不同部分的工程师经理。 所以你， 你有， 你在这里有另一个技术经理。
Okay. So just reading about like how the ByteDance and everything. So I just saw that it's the office intelligence team, right? 
好的。 所以只是阅读关于字节跳动的内容。 所以我刚刚看到是办公室情报团队， 对吗？
So it has like two types of teams. So what's the like Office intelligence team? So you're from the office intelligence team, I take it, right? 
所以它有两种类型的团队。 那么什么是Office智能团队？ 所以你来自办公室情报团队， 我想， 对吧？

So, as in like the say it handles internal like tools only. 
所以， 就像说它只处理内部工具一样。
Yeah, it not only internal tools, but most of our, most of our customers is internal, different business team from internal department. 
是的， 不仅是内部工具， 但我们的大多数， 我们的大多数客户都是内部的， 不同的业务团队从内部部门。

我们有， 我们也有很多， 我们也有任何对外提供的服务， 你知道我们有Lark， 这么多提供内部的服务可以是外部的。
Thank you. 
谢谢你。
Yeah, so like some program man management tools like the Lark office, they are all originally, they are just internal tools and then they can be export to external, you, the external users, because we, we, we, we're, we're work on the enterprise field. 
是的， 所以像一些程序管理工具，如Lark办公室， 它们都是最初的， 它们只是内部工具，然后它们可以出口到外部， 你， 外部用户， 因为我们， 我们， 我们， 我们是， 我们在企业领域工作。
Yeah. 
嗯。
Got it. Say based out of year, like currently in Dubai only, right? 
明白了。 说基于年份， 就像目前在迪拜， 对吧？
Yeah, we're incur, we're gonna be based on Dubai. 
是的， 我们招致， 我们将以迪拜为基地。
But I, from the way on only, are you from like somewhere else? 
但是我， 从路上， 你是不是来自别的地方？
We're just actually, we, this team is build in Dubai is only this year. So dubao office have already is the establish like 5 years ago, but RD team is established only this year. 
我们只是实际上，我们，这个团队是今年才在迪拜建立的。 所以杜宝办公室已经是5年前建立的了， 但是RD团队是今年才建立的。
Okay. 
好的。
Yeah. 
嗯。
So half of this team is I is relocated from China to Dubai and the other half e, the other half is hiring low, hopefully. 
所以这个团队的一半是我从中国搬到迪拜，另一半是， 另一半是低招聘， 希望如此。
Okay. 
好的。
So you will find that there are many met, there are many Chinese, also many local employees. 
所以你会发现有很多相遇， 有很多中国人， 也有很多本地员工。
Got it. I'm very excited to. I'm joining. That's it. Yeah. No other questions. Thank you very much. 
明白了。 我很兴奋。 我加入。 就这样。 是的。 没有其他问题。 非常感谢。
