There are some cases been reported recently in Russia, someone can read and recognize **(detect)** color only using fingers, even look through thick **(solid)** doors and walls. One of the case tells about a 11 years old girl student named Villa Pitlove. Her sight is just same to regular people **(She has normal vision)** but she can recognize stuff **(perceive things)** through different parts of skin even look through stiff (**solid**) wall. It's her father who found this ability. One day, Villa walked into her father's office, and **happen to** put her hand onto the door of a locked suitcase **(safe)** . She asked her father why locked so many old newspaper in the suitcase, including the wrapped situation of the newspaper. **(the way they were done up in bundles.)**

The Villa's special ability (**curious talent**) get the attention from a lab located in city of Wuliyaluo which is not far away from her home (**where she lives**). In April, A special commit(**commission**) from the Russia X department processed a serials of test on her. Under the test, she can read newspaper through opaque screen. Which is more strange is she can tell the number(**figures**) and color of card only using her elbow moving above the 'Talo' cards. And there is one time(**in other instance**), even she wears long socks(**stocking**) and slipper, she can(**was able to**) still recognize(**make out with her feet**) the scope(**outline**) and color of a picture **hidden** under a carpet. Other experiments show that her knees and shoulders have similar abilities of perception (**sensitivity**). Villa's eyes are covered(**blindfold**) under all of the experiments. Her skin can't recognize stuffs if her eyes don't been covered(**and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin**). It's 100 percent true. At the same time, even she can recognize stuff through fingers, but this function would disappeared (**the ability ceased the moment when her hands were wet** ) if her hand was wet.




We are always talking about the "Young Issue". If the issue existed, please allow me to doubt it, then it caused by old people, not young people. Let's investigate some basic truth seriously: admit young people just same to the old people. There's only one difference: young people has brighter future, but the bright experience for old people has passed. I'm afraid that's the key of the issue. 
When I was teenager, I always feels so young that I'm not able to keen on something. I'm a fresh in a university, I will feel pleased if I am been considered  an issue at that time. Because it means some sort of identity, which is seeked by young people. 
I think young people is exciting and unlimited. They don't chase name and profit and they don't stay in a comfortable of life. They don't keen to climb up(**not anxious social climber**) and also don't pursuit enjoyment of life(**devotion to material things**). In my view, All of the above connect them with the source of life and everything (**the origins of things**). To some extent, they seems to be universal person(**cosmic beings vs suburban creatures**), totally different from regular guys like us. Every time I meet young guys, such thought just emerge into my brain (**in my mind**). young people may arrogant, rude, ignorant(**conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous**), but I wouldn't defence myself with some says like respecting elders which make elder be the reason to be respected. I think we're equal. I will fight(**argue**) with them equally if I believe they're wrong.
