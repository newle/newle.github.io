There are some cases been reported recently in Russia, someone can read and recognize **(detect)** color only using fingers, even look through thick **(solid)** doors and walls. One of the case tells about a 11 years old girl student named Villa Pitlove. Her sight is just same to regular people **(She has normal vision)** but she can recognize stuff **(perceive things)** through different parts of skin even look through stiff (**solid**) wall. It's her father who found this ability. One day, Villa walked into her father's office, and **happen to** put her hand onto the door of a locked suitcase **(safe)** . She asked her father why locked so many old newspaper in the suitcase, including the wrapped situation of the newspaper. **(the way they were done up in bundles.)**

The Villa's special ability (**curious talent**) get the attention from a lab located in city of Wuliyaluo which is not far away from her home (**where she lives**). In April, A special commit(**commission**) from the Russia X department processed a serials of test on her. Under the test, she can read newspaper through opaque screen. Which is more strange is she can tell the number(**figures**) and color of card only using her elbow moving above the 'Talo' cards. And there is one time, even she wears long socks and slipper, she can still recognize the scope and color of a picture under a carpet. Other experiments show that her knees and shoulders have similar abilities of perception. Villa's eyes are covered under all of the experiments. Her skin can't recognize stuffs if her eyes don't been covered. It's 100 percent true. At the same time, even she can recognize stuff through fingers, but this function would disappeared if her hand was wet.
