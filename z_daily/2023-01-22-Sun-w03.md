sacred 和 divine 和 holy 的差別在哪裡？如果不好說明，請提供一些例句。
?
This is a great question! 
1. Divine = of or relating to god Example: I felt a divine presence = I felt the prescence of god. It can also mean really good. Example: The chicken soup is divine. = The chicken soup tastes really good.  
2. Holy = pure, clean, not corrupted by sin or dirt. This is most often used in a religious way. Example: You must be holy. = You must be clean or free from sin. 
3. Sacred = connect to god or set apart for a religious purpose Example: The sacred texts are protected. = The religious texts are protected. Sacred can also describe something that is special or important, even if it is not religious. Example: You can't read his diary. It's sacred = You can't read his diary. It's very important to him.
